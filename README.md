Pathfinding_System_Unity
Pathfinding Library for import into Unity games

This library can be imported into a Unity project in order to add pathfinding logic to units.

It is set up for a grid of moderately sized cells, but the gridSize variable can be modified to change how large the cells are when generated.

Edit the maxNumOfColumns and maxNumOfRows variables to change how many cells are generated.

This was created for use in 3d games, but can be modified for 2d. It generates a 2d grid of cells that can be toggled (isWalkable) to allow units to traverse them, or force units to go around them.
